Upstream-Name: Material Design Icons DX
Upstream-Contact: https://github.com/jossef/material-design-icons-iconfont
Source: https://github.com/jossef/material-design-icons-iconfont
Files-Excluded: .github .gitignore dist/*.min.css* docs src/docs src/fonts
Comment: - The docs folder was removed because it contains minified JavaScript
           files incompatible with the DFSG, requires the Nuxt.js framework
           and duplicates upstream's online documentation.
         - The minified CSS files are incompatible with the DFSG and have been
           removed, as have the related .min.css.map files.
         - All other files and directories excluded from the source are cruft.
